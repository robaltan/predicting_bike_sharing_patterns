# Predicting Bike Sharing Pattern in Washington D.C.

Learning the theory of neural networks is fun! With lots of derivatives flying around, a mathematically inclined people love neural networks and even take the extra steps to solve it by hand. Even though playing with neural works is fun, the fun actually starts when you apply it to real world data!

In this repository, I built a neural network with one hidden layer built from scratch to predict bike sharing patters in Washington D.C. between years 2011 and 2012 from a public dataset (please refer to the [metadata](https://github.com/robaltan/predicting_bike_sharing_patterns/blob/main/Bike-Sharing-Dataset/Readme.txt) file for instructions). To follow the steps of data processing and building the neural network, you could follow the designated [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/robaltan/predicting_bike_sharing_patterns/blob/main/neural_network_walkthrough.ipynb).


# Project Specifications

This repository meets the production specifications, which are the following:

* Jupyter Notebook runs in Python 3, passing all the unit tests.
* The sigmoid activation function is implemented correctly from scratch.
* The implementation of forward propagation is correct.
* The implementation of backward propagation updates the weight change correctly.
* Hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, the number of hidden units, and the learning rate, are picked correctly to 
achieve training loss below 0.09 and validation loss below 0.18.

# Required Tools
* NumPy
* Pandas
* matplotlib
