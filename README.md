# Predicting Bike Sharing Pattern in Washington D.C.

A neural network with one hidden layer built from scratch to predict bike sharing patters in Washington D.C. between years 2011 and 2012. Please refer to the [metadata](https://github.com/robaltan/predicting_bike_sharing_patterns/blob/main/Bike-Sharing-Dataset/Readme.txt) file for instructions. To follow the steps of data processing and building the neural network, you could follow the designated [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/robaltan/predicting_bike_sharing_patterns/blob/main/neural_network_walkthrough.ipynb).
