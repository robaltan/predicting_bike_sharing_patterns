# Predicting Bike Sharing Pattern in Washington D.C.

Learning the theory of neural networks is fun! With lots of derivatives flying around, a mathematically inclined people love neural networks and even take the extra steps to solve it by hand. Even though playing with neural works is fun, the fun actually starts when you apply it to real world data! The analysis carried out in this repository could be really useful for businesses in Netherland let's say. 

To attest this idea, I built a neural network with one hidden layer built from scratch to predict bike sharing patters in Washington D.C. between years 2011 and 2012 from a public dataset (please refer to the [metadata](https://github.com/robaltan/predicting_bike_sharing_patterns/blob/main/Bike-Sharing-Dataset/Readme.txt) file for instructions). To follow the steps of data processing and building the neural network, you could follow the designated [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/robaltan/predicting_bike_sharing_patterns/blob/main/neural_network_walkthrough.ipynb).
